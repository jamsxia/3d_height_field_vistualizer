# 3d_height_field_vistualizer
The purpose of this project is to show a polygon in a three dimensional field. In order to make it in three dimensional

1)an eye is needed, which is the point of view someone see this 3-d polygon

2)the shade should be included because of the obstruction of light in 3-d field

3)the height should be shown with differnt colors

4)picture the 2-d graph into 3-d object since computer science's picture processing is actually 2-d


Moreover, in order to finish this program, a class of "vector" should be designed. In this programe, the point of view is achieved by using vectors. 
Important parts of vector class includes cross product and scale product
